# RapidAPI Listing Readiness Assessment

_Last updated: 2025-02-14_

## Executive Summary
The project is **not ready** for a successful RapidAPI marketplace listing. Several production blockers will cause requests to fail as soon as paying users exercise the documented endpoints. Until these issues are resolved, RapidAPI's automated verification and manual review are likely to reject or suspend the listing.

## Critical Blockers

1. **Product tracking endpoint crashes immediately**  
   `api/v1/products/track.js` references helper functions (`protectedRoute`, `error`, `validateRequired`, `validateUrl`, `validateNumber`, `validateEmail`, `success`) that are never imported, so the module throws before it can register a route. Deployments using this file will respond with 500 errors for `/api/v1/products/track`, which RapidAPI tests during onboarding.【F:api/v1/products/track.js†L1-L92】

2. **Live data sources are unconfigured**  
   The eBay integration intentionally falls back to sandbox credentials and logs warnings when `EBAY_APP_ID` is missing. Without a production key the search endpoint returns an error, which RapidAPI treats as a failed health check.【F:lib/ebay.js†L7-L52】【F:lib/ebay.js†L74-L105】

3. **Database calls rely on placeholder Supabase credentials**  
   `services/database.js` currently instantiates Supabase with `https://your-project.supabase.co` and `your-anon-key`. Unless you override both environment variables in Vercel and RapidAPI, every read/write results in authentication errors, breaking product persistence and price history features.【F:services/database.js†L1-L78】【F:services/database.js†L101-L134】

4. **Production smoke test uses dummy data**  
   The `scripts/test-production.js` script still posts a fake eBay URL (`234567890123`) and a stub API key. RapidAPI reviewers often request recorded evidence of these checks using real sample data, so the script should be updated before launch.【F:scripts/test-production.js†L1-L84】

## High-Priority Fixes
- Import the missing validation and response helpers in `api/v1/products/track.js`, or refactor the handler to use the shared utility modules. Add automated tests to prevent regressions.  
- Provision and securely store production eBay credentials (`EBAY_APP_ID`, `EBAY_ENVIRONMENT`) in both Vercel and RapidAPI's Hub environment settings.  
- Configure a real Supabase (or alternative) project, create the required tables (`products`, `price_history`), and supply `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` secrets. Add connectivity checks in the health endpoint.  
- Replace the placeholder listing data in `scripts/test-production.js` with a vetted catalog item and a dedicated RapidAPI provider key so you can record a successful run for reviewers.

## Suggested Pre-Launch Checklist
1. ✅ **Unit tests** covering each endpoint path (200s and error branches).  
2. ✅ **End-to-end smoke test** that posts a real product, persists it, and records a price change.  
3. ✅ **Monitoring**: configure logging/alerting for Supabase errors and eBay quota limits.  
4. ✅ **Marketplace assets**: screenshots, code samples, pricing tiers already documented in `RAPIDAPI_LISTING.md`.  
5. ✅ **Support readiness**: verify the support inbox listed in the README is operational.

Resolving these blockers first will dramatically increase the chances that RapidAPI accepts the listing without back-and-forth rejections.
